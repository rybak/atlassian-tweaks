Selection of file paths (breadcrumbs) is broken in some parts of the Bitbucket
UI in a way, that marker "UPDATED", "ADDED", or "DELETED" is selected, depending
on the exact way that the user performs the selection.  This style makes the
pill-shaped markers unselectable, fixing this issue.

This style supports both Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Cloud.
