Commit pages on Bitbucket Cloud are not very readable.  This user style adds a
border around the commit messages, makes the font monospace, and makes the
subject line bold.  Many aspects of the style can be configured.
Demo: [monospace](https://i.imgur.com/a6nNxAI.png) and [without monospace](https://i.imgur.com/OMnBFQe.png).

This style supports only Bitbucket Cloud.
